<h1>The Best Anime Movies According To Me</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Anime movies</h2>

<Hr />

<h3>Your Name</h3>
    <p>
        Your Name is my most favourite romance anime movie because I like how the tragedy in that movie happpened 
            which is the clash of the two timeline of two people.  The movie start with the switching of the the soul 
            between two main character in this movie and surprising in the end they just know one of them is already 
            dead.  Imagine switching soul with the person that already died 3 years ago.

<h3>Weathering With You</h3>
    <p>
        Weathering With You is my another favourite movie and I like this movie because of the tragic that happen
            to that magical girl who possessed a power to stop the rain.  This movie really taught me that people who 
            possessed greatness will face a great challenge or responsibility.  It is also like "give and take", if 
            you want to gain something then you must sacrifice something.

<h3>River Flows</h3>
    <p>
        Ride Your Wave is a movie that tells  people to move on from the past life.  This story is about  a girl 
            who lost his boyfriend in tragic.  The boyfriend died after drowned at the beach and this news shook the 
            girlfriend until she starts to seeing his boyfriend in the water when she sings the song that her boyfriend
            sang to her before.  But in the end, her boyfriend himself tell her to move on because thats how life work, 
            those who dies has become the past and those live shall continue theirs life.
